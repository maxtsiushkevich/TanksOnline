This is a simple clone of the BattleCity game, written in C++ using the SFML library. 
This implementation of the game supports both online play between 2 players on different computers, and joint play on 1 computer.
TCP is used as the communication protocol.

# Instalation
The game was tested to run on macOS, but running on Linux may cause problems. And of course you must have the SFML library installed for a successful build.
run the command in the terminal while in the source folder:
```
$ make
```
To start the game enter:
```
$ ./Tanks
```

Enjoy the game!
